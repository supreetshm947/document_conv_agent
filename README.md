# 🚀 **Document Chat Agent with n8n**

## 📚 **Overview**  
This project uses **n8n** (workflow automation platform) and **Supabase** to build an automated document processing and chat application. Documents are ingested from Google Drive, converted into embeddings using **Cohere**, and stored in a vector database for efficient semantic search.

The chat interface powered by **Gemini** allows querying these documents.
